Plot one frame of the ML Downscaling Diffusion video
====================================================

The plot is a straightforward colourmap of the precipitation field, overlain with a mostly-transparent land mask.

Script to make a single frame:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../visualizations/ML_diffusion/make_frame.py


For the functions to load the data, see the :doc:`get-data page <data>`.
