A good test for the :doc:`SyCLoPS events <../SyCLoPS/index>` is to compare them with :doc:`the original weather data <../ERA5/index>`.

Basically this is as simple as plotting the SyCLoPS events on top of the ERA5 weather data. We'll keep the SyCLoPS video exactly the same, but simplify the ERA video to be less colourful.

Data access is the same as the two source videos, so we only have to do the rendering:

   :titlesonly:
   :maxdepth: 1

   Plot a single frame <plot>
   Plot all the frames and make a video <video>
