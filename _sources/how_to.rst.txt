How to reproduce and extend this work
=====================================

This project is designed to be easy to reproduce and extend. Everything involved is kept under version control in a `git repository <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git>`_. The repository is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ (and the documentation made with `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_). The repository is `<https://github.com/philip-brohan/Animations-hackathon>`_. This repository contains everything you need to reproduce or extend this work.

If you are familiar with GitHub, you already know what to do (fork or clone `the repository <https://github.com/philip-brohan/Animations-hackathon>`_): If you'd prefer not to bother with that, you can download the whole thing as `a zip file <https://github.com/philip-brohan/Animations-hackathon/archive/master.zip>`_.

As well as downloading the software, some setup is necessary to run it successfully:

These scripts need to know where to put their output files. They rely on an environment variable ``SCRATCH`` - set this variable to a directory with plenty of free disc space.

These scripts will only work in a `python <https://www.python.org/>`_ environment with the appropriate python version and libraries available. I use `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_ to manage the required python environment - which is specified in a yaml file:

.. literalinclude:: ../environments/AnimH.yml

Install `anaconda or miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_, `create and activate the environment in that yaml file <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-envs>`_, and all the scripts in this repository should run successfully. In principle this should work on any operating system and machine architecture (if all the required dependencies are available for your system - you may need to specify appropriate `conda channels <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/channels.html>`_ as well) - but I have only tested it on Linux/Intel/Nvidia.

The project documentation (these web pages) are included in the repository (in the `docs directory <https://github.com/philip-brohan/Animations-hackathon/tree/master/docs>`_). The documentation is in `reStructuredText <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ format, and uses the `Sphinx <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`_ documentation generator.
