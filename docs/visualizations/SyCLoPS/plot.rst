Plot one frame from the SyCLoPS video
=====================================

The video shows each event in the data at each time-point, and the track of each event going back to its origin.


Script to make a single frame:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../visualizations/SyCLoPS/make_frame.py


For the functions to load the data, see the :doc:`get-data page <data>`.
