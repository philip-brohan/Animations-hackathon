The `System for Classification of Low-Pressure Systems (SyCLoPS) <https://climate.ucdavis.edu/syclops.php>`_ is a system from classifying weather events from GCM outputs. It finds sequences of extreme points in the weather field. It's worth looking at those sequences: to see their dynamics, and compare them to the original data. A perfect case-study for a video diagnostic. We are going to look at the events classified by SyCLoPS from `ERA5 reanalysis <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5>`_ data.
