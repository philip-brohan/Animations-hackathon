Video Diagnostics
=================

Sometimes, a video is what you need. The weather is a complex, multivariate, dynamical system, and a video can communicate the behaviour of that system, or show the power and limitations of a model, fast and effectively. Videos are an excellent way to communicate a lot of information in a short time. They are also a great tool for outreach.

   Near-surface temperature, wind, and precipitation. From the ERA5 Reanalysis <visualizations/ERA5/index>

This page documents a few case-studies in generating video diagnostics. There's no science in this: no interpretation or discussion of what we learn from the videos. It's just a description of how to make the visualizations.
